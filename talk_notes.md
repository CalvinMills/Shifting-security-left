# Shifting security left - The security champion journey

## Security champions and dev ops – opening slide

## Start with why – Simon Sinek

Simon is an author and leadership speaker who pioneered the "Start with why" movement.
The idea is to always consider why you do something before you actually do it and is meant to, if you subscribe to the idea, lead to more inspired solutions to problems. As a result I like to first consider the problem or the why to a scenario before I dive in.

## Why am I here

Which leads me to the question, Why do you need a security champion, what problems does the initiative aim to solve?

- Devops problem - We want to deploy faster than ever, what are the repercussions in terms of security.
- Security don’t understand development teams and development teams don’t care much for security teams.
- There is so much cyber security related information, threats, tooling etc. to sift through. Spread information through the teams.
- More here…

## Fine we get it, security is hard, whats the solution

With security, as with every IT problem (I'm sure you're all tired of hearing this), there is no silver bullet. There are many solutions to the previosuly mentioned problems, what I am proposing is only one such solution.

- Define a security champion.

## But what exactly does a security champion do?

- Loosely define roles of a security champion.
- No official rituals or forums that you must attend, just start advocating best practice within your direct influence.

## Who can be a security champion?

- Anyone.

## But Calvin, why would I want to do extra work?

- Intrigued by cyber security and felt like I should know more about application security.
- Bottlenecks with security slowing us down, reducing our velocity.
- Saw the reluctance of team members to engage with security.
- Previous engineering manager introduced it as a voluntary role in order to solve some of the problems we were having.

## I’m a security champion now, great! Okay what do I do?

-General responsibilities.

## I'm lazy, are there any cheatcodes?

- Started with BSIMM – describe BSIMM and why we used it, show doc briefly and discuss the importance.
- Show our BSIMM – maybe comparisons.

## How can you get started making a maturity model?

## What have we done off the back of the BSIMM model?

- Working closely with security to become more mature.
- Key to note buy in from security team.
- S-SDLC.
- Coding standards.
- SAST improvements.
- Double checking our SLA’s with vendors.
- Investigating IAST and trying to implement it.
- What else are we doing?

## How do we stay informed?

- Follow blogs and weekly email blasts – some examples.
- Participate in guilds – Security architecture guild. Setting up/ have set up security champion guild.
- Monthly catch ups with security.
- OWASP

## How to empower members of your team to become security champions

- Reinforce idea that it isn’t an official position – key to remain a voluntary position.
- Not the most exciting but it is becoming more apparent how key it is, best people to become champions are those that are enthusiastic/passionate.
