# Shifting security left - The security champion journey

In modern development, we aim to deploy to production faster, however, when we do so, it is just as important to deploy products which are robust, not only from a fault perspective but also a security perspective, and this is where the new role of a security champion aims to provide value to the devops process.

## Start with why

**picture of simon sinek**

Does anyone know who this is?
This is Simon Sinek.
Simon is an author and leadership speaker who pioneered the "Start with why" movement.
The idea is to always consider why you do something before you actually do it and is meant to, if you subscribe to the idea, lead to more inspired solutions to problems.
As a result I like to first consider the problem or the why to a scenario before I dive in.

## Why am I here

Which leads me to the question, Why do you need a security champion, what problems does the initiative aim to solve?

- The Devops conundrum - As I noted before, most engineers understand the advantages of deploying software faster than ever.
  It is important to note that when we do, what are the repercussions in terms of security, how can we ensure that the products we deliver meet ever increasing security requirements whilst keeping up the aspirational agility of a devops system.
- Security teams and development teams can sometimes be seen as serving their own purposes instead of working together towards the common goal which is deploying quality software to our clients as fast as possible. This doesn't happen in most environments.
- Every day there are new threats being uncovered, new threat vectors surfacing that it can be difficult to keep up with the cyber security world.
- These are just some of the challenges we face in terms of the relationship between development and security when developing software in the modern landscape. But you get the picture, it's hard.

## Fine we get it, security is hard, whats the solution

With security, as with every IT problem (I'm sure you're all tired of hearing this), there is no silver bullet. There are many solutions to the previously mentioned problems, what I am proposing is only one such solution.

What is a security champion?  
There is no one specific definition, as the role has evolved over time.
Security champions are part of an app sec or development team, and their job is to learn or understand basic security issues.
The idea is that the champion would then help bridge the gap between development and security.
This definition is evolving over time and encompasses more than just understanding security issues and also relates to simple evangelism around the application security space.
Sort of like a security cheerleader of sorts.

## So do I need super powers or something

So you may be wondering, who can possibly accept all this responsibilty.
The short answer is:

- Anyone.

Anyone in the development team can act as a security champion, the main pre-requesite for being a security champion is passion. About security, about making a difference to the development team, no matter what experience you have in the industry anyone can act as a security champion.

## I’m a security champion now, great! Okay what do I do

- Help to ensure that the latest security related information is spread through their team/organisation.
- Can assist with training and simulation of real world threat scenarios.
- Liaise with security to ensure a productive relationship.
- Assist in making security decisions for the team.
- No official rituals or forums that you must attend, just start advocating best practice within your direct influence.

These are just some examples of roles a security champion can fill within their context.
In truth, a security champions' role is to do anything to help progress the application security agenda within their team/organisation through whatever means they deem most fitting.

## But Calvin, why would I want to do extra work

Okay fine, we software engineers are lazy by definition, I get it.
So why did I get into it.

My previous engineering manager introduced it as a voluntary role in order to solve some of the problems we were having in terms of security becoming a bottlenech and hampering our deployment velocity.
This really struck home for me because as a front end developer I like to deliver features fast and really get feedback from the users as soon as possible.
On top of that I have always been intrigued by cyber security and felt like I should know more about application security.
Also, no one else was going to talk to security, someone had to do it

## Okay, but I'm extra lazy, are there any cheatcodes

So this is me.
When we first started this journey I had no idea where to start.
This is when, with the help of some colleagues in AXA Germany discovered BSIMM.

BSIMM or "Building Security In Maturity Model" is an organisation dealing with understanding the maturity of an organisations security capabilities.
Basically they deal with providing an assessment to various areas of an organisation which culiminates in a maturity rating and can be invaluable when attempting to understanding where to focus your efforts when making improvements to the application development process within your organisation.

**Show CIMA BSIMM**

So I started by making this maturity model.
Using this has allowed us to not only determine what to focus on next in order to make our lifecycle more robust but also in order to track the progress we have made since starting the initiative.

## That looks like more work

You might be thinking "okay that's great once its done, but it looks like it takes alot of effort to set up".
So that it is true to some extent. You have to do a pretty thorough self assessment in order to get all the data that makes up the model, but I promise that if you leverage it correctly it can be totally worth the time it takes to make.
Also, if you're nice to me, I may be willing to send you my template!

## Impressive, but have you actually done anything other than talk

So what have we actually managed to improve on since starting this journey.

- We have worked closely with security to become more mature and foster a more productive relationship.
  - This includes attempting to resolce the bottlenecks we were having with security sign offs for releases.
  - When it comes to this point it is so important to have the security teams' buy in for the security champion initiative, because otherwise your advice will fall on deaf ears.
- Helping to document our S-SDLC and refine our process and make it more robust by ensuring we perform SAST and implement the necessary remediation and triaging of flaws.
- Documenting and refining our coding standards helping to come up with something that makes sense for the development teams and also satisfies requirements from the security teams.
- Double checking our SLA’s with vendors - this is a tricky one because once we are locked into contracts with third parties it can be difficult to change but it is important to enforce our 3rd parties are following the same level of security requirements we do.
- Investigating IAST using Seeker and trying to implement it where we can.

There are still many other areas of possible improvement but it's a start.

## How do we stay informed

- There are plenty blogs and weekly email blasts which are great sources for information on the sector, such as – some examples.
- Participate in guilds – Security architecture guild. Setting up/ have set up security champion guild.
- Regular catch ups with security in order to continue fostering the relationship you have created.
- OWASP is a non profit organisation which is great source on application security threats and a great place to start if you want to get informed.

## How to empower members of your team to become security champions

- Reinforce idea that it isn’t an official position – key to remain a voluntary position.
- Not the most exciting but it is becoming more apparent how key it is, best people to become champions are those that are enthusiastic/passionate.
