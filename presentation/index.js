          <Notes>
            In modern development, we aim to deploy to production faster,
            however, when we do so, it is just as important to deploy products
            which are robust, not only from a fault perspective but also a
            security perspective, and this is where the new role of a security
            champion aims to provide value to the devops process.

            Simon is an author and leadership speaker who pioneered the "Start
            with why" movement. The idea is to always consider why you do
            something before you actually do it and is meant to, if you
            subscribe to the idea, lead to more inspired solutions to problems.
            As a result I like to first consider the problem or the why to a
            scenario before I dive in.

            Which leads me to the question, Why do you need a security champion,
            what problems does the initiative aim to solve? The Devops conundrum
            - As I noted before, most engineers understand the advantages of
            deploying software faster than ever. It is important to note that
            when we do, what are the repercussions in terms of security, how can
            we ensure that the products we deliver meet ever increasing security
            requirements whilst keeping up the aspirational agility of a devops
            system. Security teams and development teams can sometimes be seen
            as serving their own purposes instead of working together towards
            the common goal which is deploying quality software to our clients
            as fast as possible. This doesn't happen in most environments. Every
            day there are new threats being uncovered, new threat vectors
            surfacing that it can be difficult to keep up with the cyber
            security world. These are just some of the challenges we face in
            terms of the relationship between development and security when
            developing software in the modern landscape. But you get the
            picture, it's hard.

          <Notes>
            With security, as with every IT problem (I'm sure you're all tired
            of hearing this), there is no silver bullet. There are many
            solutions to the previously mentioned problems, what I am proposing
            is only one such solution.

          <Image src={images.securityChampion} className="rounded" />
          <Notes>
            There is no one specific definition, as the role has evolved over
            time. Security champions are part of an app sec or development team,
            and their job is to learn or understand basic security issues. The
            idea is that the champion would then help bridge the gap between
            development and security. This definition is evolving over time and
            encompasses more than just understanding security issues and also
            relates to simple evangelism around the application security space.
            Sort of like a security cheerleader in some ways.

          <Notes>
            The answer is. Anyone. Anyone in the development team can act as a
            security champion, to be honest, anyone in the organisation can act
            as a security champion the main pre-requesite for being a security
            champion is passion. About security, about making a difference to
            the development team, no matter what experience you have in the
            security space anyone can act as a security champion.

            These are just some examples of roles a security champion can fill
            within their context. In truth, a security champions' role is to do
            anything to help progress the application security agenda within
            their team/organisation through whatever means they deem most
            fitting.

            Okay fine, we software engineers are lazy by definition, I get it.
            So why did I get into it. My previous engineering manager introduced
            it as a voluntary role in order to solve some of the problems we
            were having in terms of security becoming a bottlenech and hampering
            our deployment velocity. This really struck home for me because as a
            front end developer I like to deliver features fast and really get
            feedback from the users as soon as possible. On top of that I have
            always been intrigued by cyber security and felt like I should know
            more about application security. Also, no one else was going to talk
            to security, someone had to do it

            So this is me. When we first started this journey I had no idea
            where to start. This is when, with the help of some colleagues in
            AXA Germany discovered BSIMM. BSIMM or "Building Security In
            Maturity Model" is an organisation dealing with understanding the
            maturity of an organisations security capabilities. Basically they
            deal with providing an assessment to various areas of an
            organisation which culiminates in a maturity rating and can be
            invaluable when attempting to understanding where to focus your
            efforts when making improvements to the application development
            process within your organisation.

          <Notes>
            So I started by making this maturity model. Using this has allowed
            us to not only determine what to focus on next in order to make our
            lifecycle more robust but also in order to track the progress we
            have made since starting the initiative.

            You might be thinking "okay that's great once its done, but it looks
            like it takes alot of effort to set up". So that it is true to some
            extent. You have to do a pretty thorough self assessment in order to
            get all the data that makes up the model, but I promise that if you
            leverage it correctly it can be totally worth the time it takes to
            make. Also, if you're nice to me, I may be willing to send you my

            So what have we actually managed to improve on since starting this
            journey. - We have worked closely with security to become more
            mature and foster a more productive relationship. - This includes
            attempting to resolce the bottlenecks we were having with security
            sign offs for releases. - When it comes to this point it is so
            important to have the security teams' buy in for the security
            champion initiative, because otherwise your advice will fall on deaf
            ears. - Helping to document our S-SDLC and refine our process and
            make it more robust by ensuring we perform SAST and implement the
            necessary remediation and triaging of flaws. - Documenting and
            refining our coding standards helping to come up with something that
            makes sense for the development teams and also satisfies
            requirements from the security teams. - Double checking our SLAâ€™s
            with vendors - this is a tricky one because once we are locked into
            contracts with third parties it can be difficult to change but it is
            important to enforce our 3rd parties are following the same level of
            security requirements we do. - Investigating IAST using Seeker and
            trying to implement it where we can. There are still many other
            areas of possible improvement but it's a start.
